The internal audit was conducted for Pandit Deendayal Petroleum University for the period April–September 2017. The review covered
fee revenue, banking compliance, travel reimbursements, and accounting control procedures. Several high-risk issues were identified
including under-recovery of academic fees (₹35.85L), unrecovered prior year fees (₹20.92L), and excess duplicate payments. Medium-risk
areas involved delays in asset capitalization and lack of procurement comparison, while low-risk gaps were found in purchase order
processing. The audit team recommended strict fee monitoring, penalty enforcement, PO centralization, multi-vendor quotations, and
invoice-verified payments.
